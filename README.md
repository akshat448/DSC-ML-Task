### Monument Prediction using Machine Learning/Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting heritage indian monuments in the images. 

## Dataset 
We have curated a diverse dataset of monument images from around the world. The dataset includes images of famous landmarks, historical monuments, and architectural wonders. It is carefully annotated to include labels and additional metadata.

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are:

-> Develop a robust machine learning model for monument prediction.
-> Achieve high accuracy in monument recognition.
-> Explore and fine-tune various deep learning architectures.
-> Investigate transfer learning techniques for improved performance.
-> Create a user-friendly interface for predicting monuments in new images.
